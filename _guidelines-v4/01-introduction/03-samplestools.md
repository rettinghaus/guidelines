The Music Encoding Initiative provides a collection of sample encodings, which demonstrate a wide-range of uses of MEI in real-world contexts. They are available from [https://github.com/music-encoding/sample-encodings](https://github.com/music-encoding/sample-encodings){:target='\_blank'}.

For MEI, there is also a number of tools, which facilitate encoding of and working with MEI instances in various contexts. These tools are available from the [https://music-encoding.org/resources/tools.html](https://music-encoding.org/resources/tools.html) website.
